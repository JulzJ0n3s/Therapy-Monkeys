      <p>Artful is proud to present two truly unique experiences as part of its art therapy programmes.</p>
      <p>Bring your friends and family along to break away from your busy life, and give your body and soul some rest.</p>
      <p>Never have time to fit culture and art into your schedule? Join Artful at a late night exhibition!</p>
      <p>You will have the opportunity to discover an exhibition (guided or not), partake in an art class led by well-known artists and curators at the venue and/or participate in pilates or yoga classes, plus the essentials nibbles and bubbly. We conduct our events in a small group of like-minded people and we aim to group participants who come from the same or similar industries so they can share their mental health related experiences, ideas or else. Our late night events took place anytime between 9pm-1am on weekdays.</p>
      <p>Book our very first event below. We look forward to seeing you there.</p>
