  <h2>About Us</h2>
<p><i>Somethings are better left unsaid?</i></p>
<p>We don’t believe so!</p>
<p>It is not always easy to translate our felt experiences or current experiences into words.
We believe that Art Therapy & Meditation are the key to unlocking mental frustrations and challenges to find health, healing and happiness.
</p>
<p>Art Therapy uses creative expression of images in photos and the physical freedom of making images as an alternative way of exploring and addressing emotional and psychological issues</p>


  <h2>Who we are</h2>
